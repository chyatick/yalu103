Do not install things that are untested.


## Installing

| Beta 1 | not release |
| Beta 2 | not release |
| Beta 3 | not release |
| Beta 4 | Coming Soon |


## Substrate

On the iPhone 7 & Plus models the mobile substrate has been disabled due to a KPP misuse of function in the code, please respect this and do NOT get any repos that re-enable this, doing so may cause malfunction to your device. 

A youtube seem to find this GitHub, and called for a possible jailbreak release.

## Usage

I will NOT release any jailbreaks of my own. This is not in full collaboration with Luca Todesco (qwertyoruiopz) I am only using his code. 

** currently the code is only for 10.2 not 10.3, I haven’t committed to the code since it is VERY unstable and threw multiple devices in a boot loop.
